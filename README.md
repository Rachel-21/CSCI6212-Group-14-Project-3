# How to run the following program

Once you clone this project on Linux/Macos:
   ```
    cd src/
    javac Main.java
    java Main n  (where n is the number of input like 10 100 ... for example "java Main 10") 
  ```  

This will create a time_outputs.txt file in the same folder which contains all the time taken for n inputs provided.
